                <h2>What is Psychotherapy?</h2>
                <p>Psychotherapy is a way to help understand and change what's not working in your life. It may mean trying to figure out why you're not happy in your relationship, or why the more successful you become the more anxious you feel, or why you're so self-critical. Your concerns may focus on work, the personal aspects of your life, or both. In any case, psychotherapy brings highly individualized help where it is needed. It involves identifying and understanding the problems that stand between you and happiness, and then working with your therapist to improve your life.</p>
                <p>In psychotherapy you'll establish regular weekly appointment times with your therapist, then meet to talk through what's on your mind. It may surprise you to find that simply talking with a therapist will frequently lighten the load, make you feel less alone, and lessen your symptoms. As you begin to feel better about yourself, possible solutions to your problem may become more obvious.</p>
